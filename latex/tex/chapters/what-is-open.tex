After looking at ``Open is not a License'', I decided to take a look at
some of the definitions of the noun ``open'' in the dictionary, and was
inspired to write a short poem around what ``open'' might mean to
people. This poem is dedicated to my own poetry inspiration, my father
Don Goodman, who passed away in March 2015 at the age of 75.

What is open? Is it a gap or a space? Is it something in public? Or a
practice we chase?

Open is unenclosed It is an expanse Did we get here by planning? Or
merely by chance?

Open is an opportunity A chance to broaden the mind Free tools and
resources To benefit all of mankind

Open is an aperture Something you look through Access for all Not just
the few

Open is a cavern A vast empty space A new way of working Falling into
place

Open is a competition That anyone can enter A growing global movement
With sharing at its centre
