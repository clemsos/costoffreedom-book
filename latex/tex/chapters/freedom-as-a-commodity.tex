Let's say freedom is a commodity not a dichotomy.

Therefore when considering the cost of freedom, I am inclined to compare
use and exchange value. How does one quantify either? It's so very
abstract. Is freedom useless? No. Freedom fulfills the human need to
differentiate -- to ascertain what makes someone or something different.
Can one exchange freedom for something else? Yes, often for convenience,
privacy, health, or safety. Freedom is not either/or, it's an absurd
both/and of exchange and use value.

At this moment Bassel Khartabil is disappeared for communicating his
views on freedom of expression and has been forced to exchange his
freedom of mobility in addition to many other human rights. I stand with
the \#FREEBASSEL campaign in demanding Bassel Khartabil's location
information and immediate release.
