Bassel Safadi, Tural Abbasli, Fariba Pajouh. Teesta Setalvad, Eskinder
Nega, Raif Badawi. Anna Politkovskaya, Irom Sharmila, Aaron Swartz. Liu
Xiaobo, Edward Snowden, Fereshteh Ghazi.\footnote{These are names of
  journalists/writers/Internet activists from different parts of the
  world who have been harassed, imprisoned, or disappeared by their
  governments in the past few years. This list of names is obviously not
  meant to be either comprehensive, or representative; it invokes poetic
  license to remind us of what -- and who -- is at stake.}

So many names, so many faces, so many breaths. Choking, or gasping,
or\ldots{} gone. Many more names, many more faces, many more breaths -
Unknown, unseen, unheard\ldots{} Gone?

Do you know these names, Mr.~Government? Do you feel their breath? Do
you remember their faces, Mr.~Government? Did you read what they said?

They asked for freedom, Mr.~Government - Not for war. They ask for
peace, Mr.~Government, To be as we are.

Freedom is not a choice, Mr.~Government - but you have made it a place.
Hidden from all but the wealthiest, Open to a privileged gaze.

The breath remains, Mr.~Government, As does the word - So long as
freedom is a place, Mr.~Government, Its echoes will be heard.
