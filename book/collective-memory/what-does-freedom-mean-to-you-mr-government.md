<p>So many names, so many faces, so many breaths.<br>
Choking, or gasping, or... gone.<br>
Many more names, many more faces, many more breaths -<br>
Unknown, unseen, unheard... Gone?<br></p>

<p>Do you know these names, Mr. Government?<br>
Do you feel their breath?<br>
Do you remember their faces, Mr. Government?<br>
Did you read what they said?<br></p>

<p>They asked for freedom, Mr. Government -<br>
Not for war.<br>
They ask for peace, Mr. Government,<br>
To be as we are.</p>

<p>Freedom is not a choice, Mr. Government -<br>
but you have made it a place.<br>
Hidden from all but the wealthiest,<br>
Open to a privileged gaze.</p>

<p>The breath remains, Mr. Government,<br>
As does the word -<br>
So long as freedom is a place, Mr. Government,<br>
Its echoes will be heard.</p>

This list of names is obviously not meant to be either comprehensive, or representative; it invokes poetic license to remind us of what – and who – is at stake.
