# Love Letter to Computers

<p>An old WordPress installation turns into a zombie spam machine.</p>

<p>Interesting energy growing a beast of some sort.</p>

<p>Deleted accounts exist as active memories.</p>

<p>Transformative experience produces deceptive results.</p>

<p>Installed open-source software, took me three days: it never worked.</p>

<p>Technologies of intellect: learning to write, learning to write code,
learning to write code and text.</p>

<p>Humans stuck in batches in traffic while information circulates around
them.</p>

<p>Rivers, crabs and free fear on the PA. Inter-dependencies and
versioning problems.</p>

<p>Aging commitments to unclear values.</p>

<p>Seeking something to recycle in the social data wasteland.</p>

<p>Pain-relievers and arnica for the back of your neck.</p>

<p>Vanishing values of approaching deadlines.</p>
